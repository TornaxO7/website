`WGPU` is the first graphics API which I gave a serious try after being overwhelmed by [vulkan] or to be more specifique the [vulkan tutorial] (no hate though! It's a great book but it was a lot of things for me during that time)

All in all, I'd say that I'm feeling relatively comfortable now when working with `wgpu` and `wgsl`.
Thanks to the projects I'm also satisfied for my goal to get a basic understanding on how to work with a graphics api.

## Projects

Those are my biggest projects where I used `wgpu`.
