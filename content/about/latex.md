Probably the best tool to write papers (for _now_! I'm looking at you [typst]!).

When I started in university I was writing my lecture notes in it and I could keep up but I
was more focussing on writing the notes during the lecture than following it... ![][hideThePain]
So yeah. Not really a success here, haha.

Nevertheless I hope that [typst] will be its successor due to its better user experience.
