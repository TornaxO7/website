The only serious time I've worked with it was while doing the programming exercises in the "Computer graphics" lecture and
while creating the [webgl] stuff for my [website]. So yeah, if you're wondering how I added those backgrounds to my webpage: It's thanks to [webgl]!

When I created my [website] I was amazed how much easier it is to render a triangle than with [vulkan] or [wgpu].
But I guess that the learning curve wasn't that deep due to my experience with [wgpu].

As a hobby I'm writing some shaders and upload them on [shadertoy].
