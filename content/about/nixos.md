I'm currently (13th January, 2026) using [NixOS] and have a [love-hate-relationsship] with it.
Some of my friends were suggesting me it, so I tried it out ([I used Arch btw.] during that time :D (sorry, needed to do this one. Haha)).

It's great! Until it isn't...

Besides that I'm packaging various different programs to nix here and there.

Nevertheless I'm (mostly) happy with my current config so that I'm part of the [Nix/Nixpkgs/NixOS organization] as you might see from my [my github profile].
