I started to work with `docker` when I started my self-hosting journey since it was very
popular and almost any self-hosting service which I found suggested or included an installation
by using docker and I do have to agree: It's pretty neat! ![][peepoBucket]

Shoutout to [`itzg`] who created the [docker-minecraft-server] image!

Nowadays I switched over to [podman] but the experience is almost the same. ![][peepoShrug]
