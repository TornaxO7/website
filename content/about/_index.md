Hi! ![][peepoAwesome]

I'm a computer science student at the KIT. Nice to meet you ![][peepoChristmasCoffee]!

# Interests ![][peepoWoah]

There are multiple topics where I'm interested into (it varies which of them I like more)

- Graphics programming (like this background ![][hehe])
- Open Source Software
- Terminals
- Operating Systems
- Compilers

I do most of my stuff with the rust programming language since it's the language where I'm the most comfortable with ![][ferrisBongo].
