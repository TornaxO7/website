Hi! ![][peepoAwesome]

I'm a computer science student at the KIT. Nice to meet you ![][peepoChristmasCoffee]!

# "Skills" ![][peepoWoah]

Here are some topics I've worked with or I'm interested in. Next to them, I'm providing some brackets
for some examples or projects I've done about this subject.

- Graphics programming ([shadertoy], [vibe])
- Operating Systems ([PornOS] WIP)
- Compilers ([pimpf] WIP)
- Emulators ([RIP-8])

I do most of my stuff with the rust programming language since it's the language where I'm the most comfortable with ![][ferrisBongo].
